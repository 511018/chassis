# Containerizing your models easily

Chassis makes it easy to create a deployable docker image from your trained ML model.

Chassis is compatible with platforms like Modzy, KFServing, Sagemaker, Seldon-Core and more! Only the ML model file is needed to create the docker image that will set up the inference process for you.
