# Chassisml Python SDK

## Introduction

The Chassisml Python SDK offers convenience wrapper functions around the Chassisml service to automate the containerization and deployment of models to your preferred model serving platform. It is organized into two classes: 

* `ChassisClient`: interacts with the Kaniko service within Chassis
* `ChasissModel`: creates a model out of a few lines of Python code and any required model artifacts 

First, install the Chassisml SDK to get started:

```pip install chassisml```

To import the library into your editor:

```import chassisml```
