# Chassisml Python SDK

The Chassisml Python SDK offers convenience functions wrapped around the Chassisml service to automate the containerization and deployment of models to your preferred model serving platform. It is organized into two classes: `ChassisClient`, which will interact with the Kaniko service within Chassis, and `ChasissModel`, which will create a model out of a few lines of Python code and any required model artifacts.
